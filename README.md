# Machine Learning 
In this repository, I have documented and uploaded the various tasks related to machine learning that I completed in my lab using Google Colab. These tasks demonstrate my understanding of essential machine learning concepts.

## Lab Tasks Overview

### ML Lab_01 - Basic Python Programs
- **Objective**: Python Programs

### ML Lab_02 - Apply Data Pre-processing Techniques
- **Objective**: Implement data preprocessing techniques like normalization, missing value treatment, and encoding categorical variables to clean data.

### ML Lab_03 - Implement ID3 Algorithm
- **Objective**: Implement the ID3 algorithm using an appropriate dataset to build a decision tree. The tree is then applied to classify a new sample.

### ML Lab_04 - Build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- **Objective**: Implement the Backpropagation algorithm to build an Artificial Neural Network and test it using relevant datasets.

### ML Lab_05 - Implement Naïve Bayesian Classifier
- **Objective**: Implement a Naïve Bayesian classifier using a sample training dataset stored as a `.CSV` file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier using a few test datasets.

### ML Lab_06 - Implement K-Nearest Neighbours (K-NN) Classification
- **Objective**: Implement K-Nearest Neighbours classification using Python and classify data into predefined categories.

### ML Lab_07 - Implementation of K-means Clustering Algorithm
- **Objective**: Implement the K-means clustering algorithm for unsupervised learning and perform clustering on a given dataset.

### ML Lab_08 - Implementation of DBSCAN Clustering Algorithm
- **Objective**: Implement the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to perform density-based spatial clustering on a given dataset.

### ML Lab_09 - Implementation of Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm
- **Objective**: Implement the hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm for hierarchical clustering analysis on a dataset.
